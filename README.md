# Advent of Code 

![](aoc.png)

My take on Advent of Code, programmed mostly in R. 
Currently focusing on 2020, the other years (and languages) will slowly be added later, but it will take some time.

## Philosophy and Rules

### General

I do not participate in AoC to be the first or to come up with the best solutions. To me, AoC is about having fun and learning something new, while having a small goal every day. You have to enjoy the little things, after all!

My code chunks are simply representations of my programming thinking. They help me to make my programming ways more efficient by learning new ways of handling everyday code problems. And maybe they will help someone else too.

### R

* Only base R if possible
* No for-loops
* Code as short and non-verbose as possible

I am well aware that many of my solutions can be done much faster using e.g. tidyverse, but within AoC, my personal challenge to make code as efficient as possible using only "pure" R. Once I have more time, I might do alternative solutions that will focus on keeping the code to the absolute minimum, regardless of packages used.
