### Notes

Primarily focusing on R for 2021, other languages coming later.

Every day's assignment links to the AOC website. However, just in case, the assignments are backed up in the *assignments* folder. The input data generated by the website is not the same for everyone. The inputs generated for me are stored in the *data* folder.
